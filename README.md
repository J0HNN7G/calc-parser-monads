- A toy functional language to show the Curry-Howard isomorphism.
- Type expressions are formulated as intuitionistic propositional logic (IPL) and a IPL theorem prover is applied. Finally, a proof tree is expressed.

- The creation of this language is would not have been possible without [Stephen Diel's](https://www.stephendiehl.com/) tutorial, [Write You a Haskell](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/fun/).
- Thank you [Philip Wadler](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/) and [Michael Fourman](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/people/staff/Michael_Fourman.html) for teaching me about functional programming and computational logic.
